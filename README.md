# CEN4053-Group7
Group 7 Semester Project for CEN 4053

This Project is a donation website for making and tracking charitable donations.

The Goal of this Project is to provide Users with a convenient method to learn about and donate to different charities locally and across the county.

The Users that we intend this Project for are 18+ individuals who range from people who are looking to make a difference but don't know where to start, to people who already donate and want a more convenient method of tracking their contributions. 

The Scope of this Project will include local and nationwide charities, and will initially launch as a website. Possible expansions into global relief efforts and Mobile Applications in the future.

To begin, run npm start to get the server up and running.
Open an internet browser such as Google Chrome.
In the web address field, type localHost:8080 to reach the home page.
From the home page you can navigate through several charities with the up and down arrow buttons.
You can also reach the Login Page from the login button.
On the Login Page, you are given the option to become a new user by entering your First and Last name, email address, and password.
You must enter a valid email address and password in order to progress to the next screen.
Upon succesfull creation of a new user, you are displayed a table of current users.
