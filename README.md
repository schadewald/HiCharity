# CEN4053-Group7
Group 7 Semester Project for CEN 4053

This Project is a donation website for making and tracking charitable donations.

To begin, run npm start to get the server up and running.
Open an internet browser such as Google Chrome.
In the web address field, type localHost:8080/ to reach the home page.
Other addresses such as localHost:8080/login will take you to the login page,
localHost:8080/useraccount will take you to the user account page,
localHost:8080/donation will take you to the donation page.

All pages are basic text placeholders until further development.

Run ^C to shut the server down.
