# CEN4053-Group7
Group 7 Semester Project for CEN 4053

This Project is a donation website for making and tracking charitable donations.

The Goal of this Project is to provide Users with a convenient method to learn about and donate to different charities locally and across the county.

The Users that we intend this Project for are 18+ individuals who range from people who are looking to make a difference but don't know where to start, to people who already donate and want a more convenient method of tracking their contributions. 

The Scope of this Project will include local and nationwide charities, and will initially launch as a website. Possible expansions into global relief efforts and Mobile Applications in the future.

To begin, run npm start to get the server up and running.
Open an internet browser such as Google Chrome.
In the web address field, type localHost:8080/ to reach the home page.
Other addresses such as localHost:8080/login will take you to the login page,
localHost:8080/useraccount will take you to the user account page,
localHost:8080/donation will take you to the donation page.

All pages are basic text placeholders until further development.

Run ^C to shut the server down.
